# Basic HTML reponsive website 
This is a project from the **codeacademy front-end development path.**
The goals was to make a website based just on the specs given on the exercise. 
It should take into account all flex elements so the contents accomodate depending on the screen type. 

The last section doesn't work perfectly when the screen is too small, but the rest accomodates very nicely. 
It had a lot of tricky things, but was great for learning. First project using flex elements :) 

Always happy to hear any comments!
